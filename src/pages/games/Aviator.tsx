    strategy={
      <>
        <p>The most consistent <strong>Aviator strategy</strong> is the 1.5× auto-cashout: set both bets to auto-cashout at 1.5× and you win 67% of rounds for a small but steady profit curve. Mathematically it's near-breakeven, but combined with bonus rounds and YOLO365 cashback it edges into positive expected value.</p>
        <p>Aggressive players use the "Martingale-lite" — double stake after every loss, reset after a 2× cashout. It works in short sessions but blows up in long droughts, so cap your loss streak at 5 doubles maximum.</p>
        <p>Never chase a high multiplier — the plane crashes randomly and 100×+ rounds happen less than 1% of the time. Set your auto-cashout, walk away from the screen, and let the math work.</p>
